# CST_Hackathon_Scenarios
Scenarios are very open to an interpretation, we expect You to create something cool\
and we know that closing people in boxes is not the best way for the Hack! :D 

## Scenario 1
#### Target: Backend, simple UI

Think of it like an app that you would like to use with your friends durring working on student projects,\
